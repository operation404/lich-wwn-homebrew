There are many subspecies of dragon, many of which are distinguished by the colour of their scales. All dragons are egg-layers and hoard treasure in their lairs, far from areas of human civilisation.</p>\n<p>Intelligent, aquatic dragons with green scales, fin-like wings, and a yellowish crest. Dwell in the depths of the ocean, inhabiting caverns or shipwrecks. Sometimes attack vessels to steal their treasure and eat the crew.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Behaviour: </strong>Chaotic dragons usually try to eat humans, but may sometimes capture them. Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honour.</li>\n<li><strong>Pride:</strong> Dragons are immensely proud <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">creatures and will always listen to flattery.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Attack pattern:</strong> A dragon always <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">attacks first with its breath weapon, then </span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">either breathes again or makes melee </span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">attacks (equal chance of either).</span></li>\n<li><strong>Breath weapon:</strong> Can be used up to three times per day. Unless noted otherwise, all caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon&rsquo;s current hit points (Evasion save for half). Shapes:</li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cloud:</strong> 50&rsquo; long, 40&rsquo; wide, 20&rsquo; high.</li>\n<li><strong>Cone:</strong> 2&rsquo; wide at the mouth, 30&rsquo; wide at far end.</li>\n<li><strong>Line:</strong> 5&rsquo; wide along whole length.</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Energy immunity:</strong> Unharmed by their own breath weapon or lesser versions thereof. Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from fire ball spells.)</li>\n<li><strong>Language and spells:</strong> Some dragons are able to speak (their own tongue plus Common). The chance is listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells).</li>\n<li><strong>Sleeping:</strong> The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep!</li>\n<li><strong>Subduing:</strong> Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks, admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to 1,000sp per hp.</li>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and &frac14; or &frac12; as much treasure. Older dragons may have up to 3 HD more and twice as much treasure.</li>\n<li><strong>Lairs:</strong> A dragon&rsquo;s treasure is always kept in its well-hidden lair and is seldom unguarded.</li>\n</ul>","alignment":"Neutral","xp":1750,"treasure":{"table":"","type":""},"appearing":{"d":"0","w":"1d4"},"morale":9,"instinct":4,"instinctTable":{"table":"@Compendium[wwn.instinct.MLYsyBmxy0cDjUst]{Beings of Arrogant Might}","link":""},"skill":4},"attacks":"","damageBonus":2,"character":false,"hp":{"hd":"8d8","value":36,"max":36}},"token":{"name":"Sea Dragon","img":"icons/svg/cowled.svg","displayName":30,"actorLink":false,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":3,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"classes.effort1"},"flags":{"image-hover":{"hideArt":false},"wall-height":{"tokenHeight":0}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null},"items":[{"_id":"xuqNPDv0i5lZITIs","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/weapon.png","data":{"range":{"short":0,"medium":0,"long":0},"save":"","pattern":"transparent","description":"","damage":"3d8","bonus":0,"skillDamage":false,"shock":{"damage":5,"ac":18},"shockTotal":0,"skill":"punch","score":"str","tags":[],"slow":false,"missile":false,"melee":true,"price":0,"weight":0,"counter":{"value":1,"max":1},"quantity":1,"choices":"weapon,ability,armor,item"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"ShP8PiMNlzrdFpKt","name":"Breath Weapon","type":"ability","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/ability.png","data":{"description":"<p>Poison spittle, 100' range, 20' diameter.

Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honour.</li>\n<li><strong>Pride:</strong> Dragons are immensely proud <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">creatures and will always listen to flattery.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Attack pattern:</strong> A dragon always <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">attacks first with its breath weapon, then </span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">either breathes again or makes melee </span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">attacks (equal chance of either).</span></li>\n<li><strong>Breath weapon:</strong> Can be used up to three times per day. Unless noted otherwise, all caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon&rsquo;s current hit points (Evasion save for half).

Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from fire ball spells.)</li>\n<li><strong>Language and spells:</strong> Some dragons are able to speak (their own tongue plus Common). The chance is listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells).</li>\n<li><strong>Sleeping:</strong> The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep!</li>\n<li><strong>Subduing:</strong> Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks, admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to 1,000sp per hp.</li>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and &frac14; or &frac12; as much treasure. Older dragons may have up to 3 HD more and twice as much treasure.</li>\n<li><strong>Lairs:</strong> A dragon&rsquo;s treasure is always kept in its well-hidden lair and is seldom unguarded.</li>\n</ul>","alignment":"Neutral","xp":2300,"treasure":{"table":"","type":""},"appearing":{"d":"1d4","w":"1d4"},"morale":9,"instinct":4,"instinctTable":{"table":"@Compendium[wwn.instinct.MLYsyBmxy0cDjUst]{Beings of Arrogant Might}","link":""},"skill":4},"attacks":"","damageBonus":2,"character":false,"hp":{"hd":"9d8","value":40,"max":40}},"token":{"name":"Blue Dragon","img":"","displayName":30,"actorLink":false,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":3,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"classes.effort1"},"flags":{"image-hover":{"hideArt":false},"wall-height":{"tokenHeight":0}},"randomImg":true,"tint":null},"items":[{"_id":"E0sVZTE3tcfgGJxk","name":"Claw","type":"weapon","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/weapon.png","data":{"range":{"short":0,"medium":0,"long":0},"save":"","pattern":"transparent","description":"","damage":"1d6+1","bonus":0,"skillDamage":false,"shock":{"damage":2,"ac":15},"shockTotal":0,"skill":"punch","score":"str","tags":[],"slow":false,"missile":false,"melee":true,"price":0,"weight":0,"counter":{"value":2,"max":2},"quantity":1,"choices":"weapon,ability,armor,item"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"xuqNPDv0i5lZITIs","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/weapon.png","data":{"range":{"short":0,"medium":0,"long":0},"save":"","pattern":"transparent","description":"","damage":"3d10","bonus":0,"skillDamage":false,"shock":{"damage":6,"ac":18},"shockTotal":0,"skill":"punch","score":"str","tags":[],"slow":false,"missile":false,"melee":true,"price":0,"weight":0,"counter":{"value":1,"max":1},"quantity":1,"choices":"weapon,ability,armor,item"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"ShP8PiMNlzrdFpKt","name":"Breath Weapon","type":"ability","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/ability.png","data":{"description":"<p>100' long line of lightning.</p>","roll":"","rollType":"result","rollTarget":0,"blindroll":false,"save":"evasion","choices":"weapon,ability,armor,item"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"24uTPACWS2yoroW1","name":"Language and Spells","type":"ability","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/ability.png","data":{"description":"<p>40%; 4 x 1st level, 4 x 2nd level.</p>","roll":"1d100","rollType":"result","rollTarget":0,"blindroll":false,"save":"","choices":"weapon,ability,armor,item"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"0mrYeyxqty5AU3L0","name":"Sleeping","type":"ability","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/ability.png","data":{"description":"<p>20%.</p>","roll":"1d100","rollType":"result","rollTarget":0,"blindroll":false,"save":"","choices":"weapon,ability,armor,item"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":100001,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{}}

There are many subspecies of dragon, many of which are distinguished by the colour of their scales. All dragons are egg-layers and hoard treasure in their lairs, far from areas of human civilisation.</p>\n<p>Dwell in hills and mountains.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Behaviour: </strong>Chaotic dragons usually try to eat humans, but may sometimes capture them. Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honour.</li>\n<li><strong>Pride:</strong> Dragons are immensely proud <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">creatures and will always listen to flattery.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Attack pattern:</strong> A dragon always <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">attacks first with its breath weapon, then </span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">either breathes again or makes melee </span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">attacks (equal chance of either).</span></li>\n<li><strong>Breath weapon:</strong> Can be used up to three times per day. Unless noted otherwise, all caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon&rsquo;s current hit points (Evasion save for half). Shapes:</li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cloud:</strong> 50&rsquo; long, 40&rsquo; wide, 20&rsquo; high.</li>\n<li><strong>Cone:</strong> 2&rsquo; wide at the mouth, 30&rsquo; wide at far end.</li>\n<li><strong>Line:</strong> 5&rsquo; wide along whole length.</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Energy immunity:</strong> Unharmed by their own breath weapon or lesser versions thereof. Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from fire ball spells.)</li>\n<li><strong>Language and spells:</strong> Some dragons are able to speak (their own tongue plus Common). The chance is listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells).</li>\n<li><strong>Sleeping:</strong> The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep!</li>\n<li><strong>Subduing:</strong> Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks, admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to 1,000sp per hp.</li>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and &frac14; or &frac12; as much treasure. Older dragons may have up to 3 HD more and twice as much treasure.</li>\n<li><strong>Lairs:</strong> A dragon&rsquo;s treasure is always kept in its well-hidden lair and is seldom unguarded.</li>\n</ul>","alignment":"Chaotic","xp":2300,"treasure":{"table":"","type":""},"appearing":{"d":"1d4","w":"1d4"},"morale":10,"instinct":3,"instinctTable":{"table":"@Compendium[wwn.instinct.MLYsyBmxy0cDjUst]{Beings of Arrogant Might}","link":""},"skill":4},"attacks":"","damageBonus":2,"character":false,"hp":{"hd":"10d8","value":45,"max":45}},"token":{"name":"Red Dragon","img":"","displayName":30,"actorLink":false,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":3,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"classes.effort1"},"flags":{"image-hover":{"hideArt":false},"wall-height":{"tokenHeight":0}},"randomImg":true,"tint":null},"items":[{"_id":"E0sVZTE3tcfgGJxk","name":"Claw","type":"weapon","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/weapon.png","data":{"range":{"short":0,"medium":0,"long":0},"save":"","pattern":"transparent","description":"","damage":"1d6","bonus":0,"skillDamage":false,"shock":{"damage":2,"ac":18},"shockTotal":0,"skill":"punch","score":"str","tags":[],"slow":false,"missile":false,"melee":true,"price":0,"weight":0,"counter":{"value":2,"max":2},"quantity":1,"choices":"weapon,ability,armor,item"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"xuqNPDv0i5lZITIs","name":"Bite","type":"weapon","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/weapon.png","data":{"range":{"short":0,"medium":0,"long":0},"save":"","pattern":"transparent","description":"","damage":"4d8","bonus":0,"skillDamage":false,"shock":{"damage":5,"ac":null},"shockTotal":0,"skill":"punch","score":"str","tags":[],"slow":false,"missile":false,"melee":true,"price":0,"weight":0,"counter":{"value":1,"max":1},"quantity":1,"choices":"weapon,ability,armor,item"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"ShP8PiMNlzrdFpKt","name":"Breath Weapon","type":"ability","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/ability.png","data":{"description":"<p>90' long cone of fire.</p>","roll":"","rollType":"result","rollTarget":0,"blindroll":false,"save":"evasion","choices":"weapon,ability,armor,item"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"24uTPACWS2yoroW1","name":"Language and Spells","type":"ability","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/ability.png","data":{"description":"<p>50%; 3 x 1st level, 3 x 2nd level, 3 x 3rd level.</p>","roll":"1d100","rollType":"result","rollTarget":0,"blindroll":false,"save":"","choices":"weapon,ability,armor,item"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{}},{"_id":"ZYelE8WbhLJ7ktuw","name":"Sleeping","type":"ability","img":"/systems/wwn/assets/default/ability.png","data":{"description":"<p>10%.</p>","roll":"1d100","rollType":"result","rollTarget":0,"blindroll":false,"save":"","choices":"weapon,ability,armor,item"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.0mrYeyxqty5AU3L0"}}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":100001,"permission":{"default":0,"mgBwP0sTLP1VFg1m":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Actor.2vomoiTlYQI3ER9X"}}}

Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honour.</li>\n<li><strong>Pride:</strong> Dragons are immensely proud <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">creatures and will always listen to flattery.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Attack pattern:</strong> A dragon always <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">attacks first with its breath weapon, then </span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">either breathes again or makes melee </span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">attacks (equal chance of either).</span></li>\n<li><strong>Breath weapon:</strong> Can be used up to three times per day.

Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from fire ball spells.)</li>\n<li><strong>Language and spells:</strong> Some dragons are able to speak (their own tongue plus Common). The chance is listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells).</li>\n<li><strong>Sleeping:</strong> The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep!</li>\n<li><strong>Subduing:</strong> Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks, admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to 1,000sp per hp.</li>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and &frac14; or &frac12; as much treasure.

Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honour.</li>\n<li><strong>Pride:</strong> Dragons are immensely proud <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">creatures and will always listen to flattery.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Attack pattern:</strong> A dragon always <span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">attacks first with its breath weapon, then </span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">either breathes again or makes melee </span><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-primary); font-size: var(--font-size-14);\">attacks (equal chance of either).</span></li>\n<li><strong>Breath weapon:</strong> Can be used up to three times per day.

Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from fire ball spells.)</li>\n<li><strong>Language and spells:</strong> Some dragons are able to speak (their own tongue plus Common). The chance is listed by subspecies. Those that can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells (the listed number and level of spells).</li>\n<li><strong>Sleeping:</strong> The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep!</li>\n<li><strong>Subduing:</strong> Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks, admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to 1,000sp per hp.</li>\n<li><strong>Age:</strong> The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and &frac14; or &frac12; as much treasure.
